# Raj Fish Meal and Company Process Automation Undergraduate [BCA] Final Year Internship Project
Project was to automate system of Raj Fish Meal & Oil. Co. Udupi. By automating this system we can reduce manual work by great extent with the user friendly interface. This software helps the system to update itself as there are any transactions taking place.

This software gives a clear view of employee details, various inventory levels, purchase and sales details, supplier information and weigh bridge. It provides accurate results in form of reports like purchase report, daily reports, factory consumption report, stock report, sales report and update stock momentarily on the occurrence of each transaction. Also this software provides security from unauthorized accessing of data.
